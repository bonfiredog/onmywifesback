A repository of all the digital files relating to *On My Wife's Back*, a multimedia historical narrative about polar exploration in the 19th century: begun whilst serving as Interactive-Writer-In-Residence at the [British Library](http://bl.uk) in 2014-2015.

Includes files relating to the project's website, interactive fiction elements built in [Twine 1.4](http://twinery.org), GIS data, a Linux-based ad-hoc network box which was installed in the gallery space (based on the [Piratebox](https://piratebox.cc/) software) and a hand-built, HTML/CSS/JS document viewer for manuscripts.
