				<p>Welcome to <strong>No. 43 'Caddis Marian'</strong>, part of the residency of Rob Sherman, the Interactive-Writer-In-Residence at the British Library. Despite the unorthodox appearance, please be assured that you		
				are not connected to anything illegal, nefarious or antique; if you do wish to return your browser to normal at any time, merely disconnect from this wireless network and select another, more colonised network of your choice.</p> 
				<p>
				<strong>No. 43 'Caddis Marian'</strong> is the artistic and narrative name for a small piece of hardware called a 'Piratebox', currently installed in the <i>Lines In The Ice</i>
				exhibition at the Library. You may even spot it, if you have a nose for such things. This 'Piratebox' create its own wireless signal, called <strong>'caddismarian'</strong> in your network list, and to connect to it you must be physically close to the device at all times. 
				If you leave the exhibition space, you are likely to lose <strong>'caddismarian'</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
				Despite its rather unfortunate name, a Piratebox is nowhere near as shady as it sounds. It is simply a minuscule computer, around the size of a credit card, attached to a wireless adapter and a hard drive 
				for storing files. Though you are connected to the device wirelessly, its network is entirely <strong>local</strong>; in other words, there is no connection to the Internet, and you can only interact with the software installed on the Piratebox directly. 				
				For example, a connected user can:</p>
					<ul id="ulabout">
					<li>&angsph;&nbsp;leave anonymous (or perhaps synonymous) chat messages for other users to discover. Indeed, if there is more than one user connected at any one moment, this chat can occur in real time;</li><br />
					<li>&angsph;&nbsp;browse and download files stored on the Piratebox;</li><br />
					<li>&angsph;&nbsp;Upload their own files to the device for others to peruse.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				The Piratebox is simple and cheap to build, and from its basic codebase springs hundreds of potential uses. It is currently being deployed by activists, teachers, librarians and even artists all around the world.
				When you are connected to the Internet again, you can find more information at <u>http://piratebox.cc</u>, including a guide to building your own. 
				</p>
				<p>
				As a writer who specialises in digital technologies, Rob wanted to use a Piratebox as part of his residency, a project collectively called <i>On My Wife's Back</i>. Using many different mediums, including the Piratebox,
				Rob's work tells the stories of a fictional polar explorer, Isaak Scinbank, who in 1852 travels high into the Arctic to try and find Sir John Franklin, an older and markedly-more-glorious commander who, to the chargrin 
				of the entirety of England, is lost amongst the ice whilst searching for the Northwest Passage. Some of this story is contained within the exhibition space itself; you can read Scinbank's biography on the walls, almost as if he had existed at all, 
				and flick through his tattered, artefactual sea-diary to which Rob will adding, in Scinbank's spidery hand, week by week. However, Rob also wanted elements of the story to be less accessible, their discovery requiring 
				curiosity and an investigation of the 'theoretical' space of the exhibition; that is, the electromagnetic mappings swirling between our bones and teeth and clothes, all around us, so invisible and accepted that they may as 
				well not at exist at all. This would be a particular departure for the museum visitor, a breed of the public whose attention is entirely focussed on the 
				physical, exhibited space, and yet removed from it by the glass, climate control and appropriately stern warnings from curators not to touch. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The Piratebox became the endpoint of these ideas, and within the world of <i>On My Wife's Back</i> 
				it came to stand for a very physical, yet abstractly networked, element of Scinbank's expeditions: his cairns. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Like many Victorian explorers, Scinbank left caches of supplies, food and messages at strategic points throughout the Arctic archipelago, in case he needed to return in direr straits at a later date, or indeed if
	another Englishman passed that way in the future, perhaps himself in need of assistance or wondering what had happened to the original expedition. These caches were often contained inside long copper tubes provided by the British Admiralty, 
	and buried under tall piles of rocks called 'cairns', which served both to protect the caches from wildlife and weather, and to act as distinguishable points in a vast landscape. 
The Piratebox that Rob has built is a digital synecdoche of one of these cairns, namely the forty-third that Scinbank built. The man was a keen angler, and he named this cairn 'Caddis Marian', after one of
his favourite fishing flies.
</p>
<p>
By connecting to this 'digital cairn' you are taking on the mantle of some other soul, English or not, who has come across Scinbank's repository in a lonely, uninhabited stretch of the Arctic. You have dismantled the stones, extracted the copper cylinder, 
and stand examining it and its contents. You can see engravings, soldered lettering, the records of Scinbank and perhaps others who have passed through this place, as well as some of the documents, mementoes and palimpsests that have been left inside.
You too can incise your messages for others to find, as a enduring witness to your passing of this place. You can even deposit documents, supplies or items of your own, for future travellers who may also spot the cairn on the horizon. 
</p>
<p>
You can explore the cairn's different areas and functions using the <strong>'Home'</strong>, <strong>'Cache'</strong> and <strong>'Concerning'</strong> buttons near the top of each page. As his residency progresses, Rob will deposit more messages and materiel into the cairn; 
he may even be nearby, right now, within the range of wireless signal, feverishly FTPing on his laptop. You may wish to return to the exhibition at a later date, to see what has
been cached in your absence. You may even find that Scinbank has returned to his own landmark, and responded to the messages you have left concerning the weather, the fortunes of your crew and the extent of your scorbutics.

				<u><strong>A Note On Uploading Your Own Files</strong></u><br /><br /> 
				<p>Rob is keen for people to submit their own work, art and suggestions to his residency using any method they wish, including via upload to this Piratebox. 
				Making this device open and available to the public is an exercise in experimentation and trust, and he looks forward to everybody honouring the spirit in which it is offered. Before you <strong>upload any file
				to this Piratebox, or indeed download any, please read the following rules very carefully:</strong></p>
				<ul id="ulabout2">
					<li>&angsph;&nbsp;You must download anything with the same care that you would with files from the Internet; neither Rob nor the British Library can guarantee the security or contents of any file on 
					this device. Please make sure to run virus checks on any file that you download before you open it.</li><br />
					<li>&angsph;&nbsp;Rob will never upload executable files (ending in .exe) to this Piratebox. .exe files, which when opened run a program, have poor security and can be used to 'execute' viruses or other malicious software on your computer. Never open an .exe found on this 
					device, and if you do find one uploaded please <a href="mailto:rob@bonfiredog.co.uk">email Rob about it directly</a>;</li><br />
					<li>&angsph;&nbsp;Consequently, please do not upload any .exe files to this device;</li><br />
					<li>&angsph;&nbsp;Do not upload any file over 5MB in size. This limit should allow for most images and document files;</li><br />
					<li>&angsph;&nbsp;Do not upload anything illegal, copyrighted, derogatory or unsuitable, as common sense dictates;</li>
				</ul>
				</div>
				<br />
				<p>
				Despite these warnings, Rob remains hopeful that this Piratebox will be an exciting, experimental component of <i>On My Wife's Back</i>, the final significance of which he cannot predict,
				and he is excited to see what you will cache here, alongside Scinbank's leavings.
