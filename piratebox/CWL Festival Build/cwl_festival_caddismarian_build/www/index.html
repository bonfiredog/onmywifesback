				<div id="abouttext">  
				<p>This digital repository is part of the multi-modal historical art project <em>On My Wife's Back</em>, by writer, musician and games designer Rob Sherman.</p>

                <p>Rob was an honoured recipient of the <strong>CreativeWorks Entrepreneur-in-Residence funding</strong>, an <abbr title="Arts & Humanities Research Council">AHRC</abbr> initiative to facilitate creative partnerships between cultural institutions and individual artists. In Rob's case, he undertook a six-month residency at the British Library, attached to the <em>Lines In The Ice</em> public exhibition. This exhibition focussed on the heritage of European and American Arctic exploration from the 1500s to the present day, with a particular focus on one particular Victorian example. In 1845, the sailor and diplomat John Franklin set sail from Kent with two ships, the <em>Erebus</em> and <em>Terror</em>, to search for the fabled ice-free route across the northern shores of Canada and down into the Pacific, for centuries mythologised as the Northwest Passage. Both ships disappeared, and neither Franklin nor his crews were ever seen alive again. After many costly search missions financed both by the Admiralty and Franklin's own wife, Lady Jane, details emerged of the grisly fate of Franklin's mission: starvation, tuberculosis and madness caused by lead poisoning. There even emerged evidence of cannibalism amongst the desperate men.</p>
             
                <p><em>On My Wife's Back</em>, an ongoing project which spreads across many different media, is the result of Rob's research into this historical period. It tells the story of Captain Isaak Scinbank, one of many sailors commissioned by Lady Jane Franklin to lead their ships up into the Arctic in search of her husband. The project seeks to muddy fact and fiction in order to draw a contrast between official, encoded history (such as the physical artefacts, documents and contextualising labels on display in a museum exhibition) and the lost vernacular of the past; the conversations, fleeting thoughts, subjective experiences and lost stories that comprise the bulk of human life.</p> 
                
                <p>This part of the project that you are now exploring is an experiment in representing a piece of technology and architecture almost unique to the Arctic regions at the time of Franklin and Scinbank; <strong>a stone cairn.</strong></p>

                <p>The barren archipelago that makes up the Canadian Arctic is an inhospitable place for most. There are no trees to build boats, sparse animals and plants for food, and the ice that annually floats south from the poles is terrifyingly unpredictable. Many explorers in the 19th century tried to overcome some of these difficulties by copying the Inuit practice of building cairns: tall piles of unmortared rocks and stones, usually set high on hillsides near the shoreline. As well as serving as landmarks, these cairns could be used to securely store supplies of food, clothing, fresh water and other useful items. If an expedition ever passed the site of one of their cairns again, or indeed came across the cairn of another explorer, they could be almost certain of finding something to eat and other items necessary for survival. As time went on, many explorers took to using these cairns as ways of communicating with other expeditions asynchronously; leaving messages, documents and letters to be found at a later date which described the general state, their observations of the landscape and any deaths, injuries or other setbacks encountered along the way. Many sealed their fragile missives inside long copper cylinders; indeed it was one of these cylinders, discovered on King William Island in 1859, that revealed the fate of John Franklin's expedition.</p> 
                    
                <p>While we cannot provide you with a real cairn (health and safety being what it is), this <strong>'digital cairn'</strong> seeks to simulate one of the copper cylinders that Isaak Scinbank might have left behind on his travels in the Arctic. We invite you to explore this repository on your own device, and in your own time. You can <strong>leave a message in the Register Of Visitation</strong>, as if you were a tired and hungry explorer come across one of Scinbank's cairns and wishing to commemorate your visit. You can <strong>download and keep documents, ebooks and images</strong> that Isaak Scinbank might have stored in such a place to provide a record of his passage. You can even contribute to <em>On My Wife's Back</em> yourself by <strong>uploading something from your device</strong> onto the 'digital cairn'. All contributions will be publicly thanked on the <em>On My Wife's Back</em> blog, and will be used as direct inspiration for the growing multi-modal narrative of Scinbank's journeys. Anything and everything can be submitted; a photo from your gallery, a poem, a name, a story or even a recording of your voice. Your submission might end up being part of a diary entry by Scinbank, a line in a song, or even the inspiration for a videogame.</p>
                    
                    
                <p>All uploads, downloads and messages posted on the cairn are entirely anonymous, and therefore we ask you to adhere to these few rules when interacting with the 'digital cairn':</p>
                <ul>
                <li>&angsph;&nbsp;Please do not upload any illegal, copyrighted, hateful, harmful or otherwise unsuitable files or text, as your common sense dictates.</li><br />
                <li>&angsph;&nbsp;Please do not upload any files over 5MB in size.</li><br />
                <li>&angsph;&nbsp;By uploading your files or text to the cairn, you agree that they can be used artistically in the <em>On My Wife's Back</em> project by the artist, Rob Sherman. He can be contacted by email if you have any concerns or regrets, and is very friendly, reasonable and understanding; he has no interest in using people's contributions against their will.</li><br />
                <li>&angsph;&nbsp;While all the documents, images and other files provided by Rob here for download are perfectly safe, do take the same care with downloaded files as you would when connected to the Internet itself. Run a quick virus check on any file that you are not sure about, and never open any executable files (files ending in <code>.exe</code>). Rob has not uploaded any of these himself, and so please tell somebody in the exhibition if you find any of these files.</li>
                </ul>
                    
                <p>When you have finished exploring the 'digital cairn', <strong>just manually disconnect from this wireless network.</strong> If you move too far away from the cairn itself (the innocuous little box on the gaudy table), the network will disconnect automatically.</p>

                <p>Any questions that you have can be answered by the artist himself: when he is not performing music from <em>On My Wife's Back</em> today (at 1.30pm and 3.30pm in the Chapel), Rob will be manning the exhibition and available for a chat, a cup of tea, or a polite argument.</p>
