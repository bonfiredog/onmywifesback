The &apos;Ilam&apos; aground here, at the place of Mr. Scinbank&apos;s cairn and ruined encampment, for over one month to watch the sound and pass on any news coming North or South with other ships along the channels from here. No injuries save for sunstrike and malnutrition. Being too late in the season for the cariboo to move north over the ice, and yet too early for their return south, we were reduced to eating the bracken mentioned by Commander Gisholm mixed with &apos;stepmother&apos;s blessing&apos; and gunpowder in place of pepper, to which all men have become accustomed. The captain has taken to leading calisthenics on the beach, and a parade is planned for tonight. We return south tomorrow in anticipation of the closing ice and the end of the hunting season. No sign of any other vessel. Meteorology from Mr. Wirkham is enclosed. By our god, GOD</data></div>
